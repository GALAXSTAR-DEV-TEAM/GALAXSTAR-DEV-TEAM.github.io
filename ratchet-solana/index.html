        Ratchet & Clank: Battle in Solana is a fan-made online game made by the Galaxstar team. You can fight your friends with brand new weapons, but also using some famous weapons from the series !
        Fight in maps you never saw before in any online gamemodes from the series, as Daxx, Merdegraw and new maps, but also in fantastic original maps made by ourself, as the Hydralis' Seavault.
        You can also re-discover some maps of the series we remastered, with brand new textures, upscaled models and brand new map elements !
        Discover a brand new gameplay experience, based on Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal, Ratchet & Clank Future series, and Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault, for example 4 auxiliary generators, and 2 main generators locked until the auxiliary ones are destroyed.
        Capture nodes using your Omniwrench (which is customizable !), choose your hero among a large choice of characters as Ratchet, Clank, Qwark, Talwyn, Rivet, Cronk, Zephyr, and a lot more !
        All these components are purchasable in game with <br>bolts</br>, but you will <br>NEVER</br> have to pay anything with real money. <br>There is no in-app purchase with real money</br>, no pay to win !
        All players are equal !
